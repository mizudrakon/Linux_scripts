# Linux_scripts
A collection of some linux scripts so I'll be able to better find them. Some are homeworks that weem usable outside of the original context, some are new.

## contents   
 - bomba.sh: just a countdown from a given number that threatens you... don't give it a vary high number since it won't just take ctrl+C to stop.   
 - formatter.sh: takes a number and a text file to output the text formatted to have the specified row width.   
 - guess.sh: guess a random number, it will tell you to go higher or lower so you can finish quickly.
 - run.sh: runs everything in the argument array (it was an old homework, I might improve it somehow if I'm in the mood).   
 - sort_photos.sh: takes a pile of photos and sorts them into directories named by year and month.
